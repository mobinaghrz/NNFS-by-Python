neural networks or Artificial Neural Networks: type of machine learning often conflated with deep learning.
# deep neural network is having two or more hidden layers. these hidden layers are ones that the neural network controls. It’s reasonably safe to say that most neural networks in use are a form of deep learning.

Here’s a summary with the key points:

# Machine Learning Types**: 
  - **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models for tasks like classification (e.g., predicting "normal" vs. "failure" for server data).
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data.
  - **Regression**: Predicts continuous numerical values (e.g., stock prices).
  
# Example: 
    - **Sensor data from a server, including metrics like upload/download rates, temperature, and humidity, is used for failure prediction. The data is labeled as "normal" or "failure," and the goal is to train a model to predict server failure based on this data.

# - **Features and Samples**: Sensor measurements are called features, and a group of features forms a sample, which is used to train machine learning models.

# - **Classification**: The task of categorizing data into predefined labels (e.g., "normal" or "failure").

# - **Neural Networks**: Used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning.

The focus is on classification and regression with neural networks, but it opens the door to other learning methods like reinforcement and semi-supervised learning.

    Since 2010, neural networks have been on a meteoric rise due to their sometimes seemingly magical ability to solve problems previously deemed unsolvable, such as image captioning, language translation, audio and video synthesis, and more.

Currently, neural networks are the primary solution to most competitions and challenging technological problems like self-driving cars, calculating risk, detecting fraud, and early cancer detection, to name a few.
