neural networks or Artificial Neural Networks: type of machine learning often conflated with deep learning.
# deep neural network is having two or more hidden layers. these hidden layers are ones that the neural network controls. Itâ€™s reasonably safe to say that most neural networks in use are a form of deep learning.
